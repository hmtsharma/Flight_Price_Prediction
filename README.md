The project "EDA for Airline Price Prediction" involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to gain insights and prepare the data for building a predictive model to estimate airline ticket prices. Here's an overview of the steps involved in this project:

- Data Understanding: Begin by understanding the dataset and its structure. Review the column names, data types, and the overall layout of the data. Identify the target variable, which in this case is the "Price" column, as this is what we want to predict.

- Data Cleaning: Clean the data to ensure its quality and usability. Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. This step is crucial for accurate analysis and modeling.

- Descriptive Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical columns like "Duration" and "Price". This provides a summary of the data distribution and helps identify any unusual patterns.

- Data Visualization: Create visual representations of the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. Use techniques like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts to explore the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and analyze correlations between variables.

- Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the data. For example, you could extract additional information from the "Departure Time" and "Arrival Time" columns to capture patterns or create new derived features such as day of the week or time of the day.

- Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that have a strong correlation with the target variable. This step helps reduce noise and improve the efficiency of the predictive model.

- Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset. Outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of the predictive model, so it's important to detect and address them appropriately.

- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. Scale numerical features if necessary to ensure all variables are on a similar scale.

- Data Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the predictive model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

By performing these steps, I gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, identify important patterns and relationships, and prepare the data for the subsequent stages of building a predictive model for airline price prediction.
